Cascading style sheets(CSS).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selector - The element that style applied to.
~~~~~~~
Property - Style name
~~~~~~~
Value - value of a style.
~~~~~

Property 1 : Value 1:
Property 2 : Value 2:
Example :
h1{
border:1px dashed green;
color:red;
}

3ways of CSS Implementation:

(1)Inline Style Sheets:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Style applied to one line or one tag.


Syntax:
~~~~~~
<selector-tag style="property:value;roperty:value;>

Example:
~~~~~~~
<h1 style="color:red;background color:Yellow">


(2)Internal style sheets:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Style applied to one entire web page.

(3)External style sheets:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Style applied to one or more web pages.

*******UNIT:10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


CSS Associates style rules with html elements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CSS works by associating rules with html elements.
these rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed.
A CSS rulecontaines two parts:a selector and a declaration.
[p{]->selector

     font-family: Arial;}->Declarartion
Selectors:
~~~~~~~~~
Indicate which element the rule applies to.
The same rule can apply to more than one element if you seperate the 
element names with commas.  
Declaration:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Indicate how the elements refered to in the selector should be styled.
Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value),and are
separated by a colon.


CSS Properties affect how elements are displayed:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Properties:
~~~~~~~~~~
Indicate the aspects of the elements you want to change.
for example,color,font,width,height and border.
values:
~~~~~~
Specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties.for example,
if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want 
the text in these elementsto be.   

USING EXTERNAL CSS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<link>:
~~~~~~
The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the brower where to find the CSS
file used to style the page.it is an empty element(Meaning it does not need a closing tag).
it lives inside the <head>element.It should use three attribute.
href:
~~~~
This specifies the path to the CSS file(Which is often placed in a floder called CSS or style).
Type:
~~~~
The attribute specifies the type of document being linked to the valuer should be text/CSS.
relationship:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is specifies the relationship bewteen the html page and the files it is linked to.
the value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS files.


USING INTERNAL CSS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<Style>:
~~~~~~~
Allows all pages to use the same style rules(rather than repeating them in each page).
Keeps the content separate form how the page looks.
Means you can change the style used across all pages by altering just one file.
rather than each individual page.


CSS SELECTOR:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific
elements in an HTML document.
*UNIVERSAL SELECTOR:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*{}
*TYPE SELECTOR:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
h1,h2,h3{}
*CLASS SELECTOR:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.Note{}
p.note{}
ID SELECTOR:
~~~~~~~~~~~
#INTRODUCTION{}
child selector:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<li><a> {}
DESCEDANT SELECTOR:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
p a{}
ADJACENT SIBLING SELECTOR:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
h1+p{}
GENERAL SIBLING SELECTOR:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
h1~p{}



How CSS Rules Cascade:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LAST RULE:
~~~~~~~~~~
If the two selectors are identical,the latter of the two will taake precedence.
Here you can see the second i selector takes precedence over the first.
SPECIFICYITY:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
IF one selector is more specefic than the others,the more specific rule will
 take precedence over more general ones.In this example:
h1 is more specific than p*
p bis more specific than p
p#intro is more specific than p
IMPORTANT:
~~~~~~~~~
YOU can add!important after any property value to  indicate that is should be considered
more important than ofter rules that apply to the same element.



INHERITANCE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
IF YOU specify the font-family or color properties on the <BODY>element,they will apply
to most child elements.this is because the value of the font-family property is inherted
by child elements.
You can compare this with the background-color or border properties;
they are not inherited by child elements.

******UNIT:11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FOREGROUND COLOR:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
COLOR:
~~~~~
THE color property allows you to specify the color of text insides an element.
you can specify any color in CSS in one of the three ways:
HEX CODES:
~~~~~~~~~~~
THESE are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red,green,and the pink ina color,
preceded by a pound or hash(#)sign. for example:#ee3e80
RGB VALUES:
~~~~~~~~~~~
THESE express color in terms of how much red,greemand pink are used to make it up.
for:rgb(100,100,90)
COLOR NAMES:
~~~~~~~~~~~
THERE ARE 147 predenfined color names that are recognized by browers .
for example:(Darkcyan)




BACKGROUND_COLOR:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CSS treats each html element as if it appears in a box,and the background-color
property sets the color of the background for that box.


CSS3:OPACITY:Opacity,rgba
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity an of element
and any of its child elements.
these values is a number bewteen 0.0 and 1.0(so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15
is 15% opacity)



CSS3:HSL&HSLA:hsl,hsla
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The hsl colr prorerty ha s been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify color.
the value of the property starts with letters hsl,followed by induvidual values inside parenthesefor:

HUE:
~~~~ 
This is expressed as an angle (bewteen 0 and 360 degree).

SATURATION:
~~~~~~~~~~
This is expressed as an percetanges.

LIGHTNESS:
~~~~~~~~~~
This is expressed as a percetange with 0% being white 50% being normal,and 100%
being black.

ALPHA:
~~~~~~
This is as a number bewteen 0 and 1.0. 
~~~~~~~~~~~



 ****TEXT:
~~~~~~~~~~
SPECIFYING TYPEFACES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The fon-family property allows you to specify the typespace that should be used for
any text inside the element(S)to which a CSS rule applies.
The value of this property is the name of the typeface you want to use.


Size of type:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
font-size:
~~~~~~~~~
The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font.there are several ways to specify 
the size of a font.the most common are:
Pixels:
~~~~~~
Pixels are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control over how much 
space their text takes up.the number of pixels is followed by the letters px.
Percentages:
~~~~~~~~~~~
The default size of text in browers is 16px. so a size of 75% would be the equivalent of 
12px,and 200% would be 32px.
EMS:
~~~~
An em is equivalent to the width of a element.
We will look at these measurements in greater detail on the next page.

More Font Choice:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Font-family :
~~~~~~~~~~~
The specifies the name of the font.This ma,e can then be  used as a value of the 
font-family property in the rest of the style sheet.(as shown in the rule for the <h1>
and<h2>elements).
SOURCE:
~~~~~~~
This specifies the path to the font.In order for this techinque to work in all browers,
you will probably need to specify paths to a few different versions of the font,as shown
on the next page.
Format:
~~~~~~~
This specifies the format that the font is supplied in.
(It's discussed in detail on the next page.) 


Understanding font Formats:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This various font formats should appear in your code in this order:
1.eot
2.woff
3.ttf/otf
4.svg

BOLD:
~~~~
FONT-FAMILY:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The font-weight property allows you to create bold text.
There are two values that this property commonly takes:
Normal:
~~~~~~
This causes text to appear at a normal weight.
Bold:
~~~~
This causes text to appear bold.
In this example,you can see that the element whose class attribute has a value of
credits has been bolded.


Italic:
~~~~~~~
font-style:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Normal:
~~~~~~
This causes text to appear at a normal style(as opposed to italic or oblique).
Italic:
~~~~~~~
This causes text to appear italic.
Oblique:
~~~~~~~~
This causes text to appear oblique.
In this example,you can see that the credits have been italized.


UNDERLINE&STRIKE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text-Decoration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The decoration property allows you to specify the following values:
None:
~~~~
This removes any decoration already applied to the text.
Underline:
~~~~~~~~~
This adds a line underneath the text.
Overline:
~~~~~~~~
This adds a line over the top of the text. 
Line-through:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This adds a line through words.
blink:
~~~~~
This animates the text to make it flash on and off(however this is
generally frowed upon,as it is considered rather annoying).

Leading:
~~~~~~~
line-height:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Leading(pronounced ledding)is aterm typographers use for the vertical space bewteen
lines of text.In a typeface ,the part of a letter that drops beneath the baseline
is called a descender.
While the highest point of a letter is called the ascender.leading is measured 
form the bottom of the decender on one line to the top of the ascender on the next.

Letter&Word spacing:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Letter-spacing,word-spacing:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kerning is the term typographers use for the space bewteen each letter.you can 
control the space bewteen each letter -spacing property. 



Alignment:
~~~~~~~~~
text-align:
~~~~~~~~~~
The text-align property allows you to control the alignment of text.
the property can take one of four values.
Left:
~~~~~
This indicates that the text shoulds be left-aligned.
Right:
~~~~~
This indicates that the text should be right-aligned.
Center:
~~~~~~~
This allows you to center text.
Justify:
~~~~~~~~
This indicates that every line in a paragraph, except the last line,
should be set to take up the full width of the containing box.


Vertical Alignment:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
vertical-align:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The vertical-align property is a common source of confusion.
It is not intended to allow you to vertically align text in the 
middle of block level elements such as a <p>and<div>,although it
does have this effect when used with table cells are(<td>and<th>
elements).
Base line
Sub script
Super script
Top
Text-top
middle
bottom
text-bottom
It can also take a lenght(usually specified in pixels or ems)
or a percentage of the line height.

Indenting Text:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text-indent:
~~~~~~~~~~~
The text-indent property allows you to indent the first line of text
within an element.the amount you want the line indented by can be specified 
in a number of ways but is usually given in pixels in ems.

CSS3: Drop Shadow:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
text-shadow:
~~~~~~~~~~~
The text-shadow property has become commonly used despite lacking
support in all browsers.

First Letter OR LINE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:FIRST-Letter;:First-line:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can specify different values for the first letter or first line of
text inside an element using 
:first-letter and
:first-line
Technically these are not properties.
there are known as pseudo-elements.


STYLING LINKS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:LINK,:VISITED:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In CSS,there are two pseudo-classes that allows you to set different
styles for links that havea and have not yet been visited.
:LINK:
~~~~~
This allows you to set styles for links that have not yet been visited.
:Visited:
~~~~~~~~~
This allows you to set styles for links that have been clicked on. 

Responding to users:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:hover;:active;:focus

There are three element pseudo-classes that allows to change the apperence of the elements
when a user is interacting with them.
:hover:
~~~~~~~
This applied when a user hovers over an element with a pointing device as a mouse.

:Active:
~~~~~~~
This is applied when an elememnt has focus.any element that you can interact with such as
link you can click on or any form control can have focus.


**********UNIT:13:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BOX DIMENSIONS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Width,height:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents.To set your own dimensions
for a box you can use the height and width properties. 

Limiting width:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Min-width,Max-width:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen.
In such designs,the min-width property specifies the smallest size box can be

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
